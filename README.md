### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a student at Boston University who is a lifelong learner! I'm especially interested in full-stack development, game development, and machine learning. I'm currently working on improving my full-stack application development skills and focused on learning React + Flask. I'm always looking to meet new people, connect, and learn.
